# Ambulance_booking_system

Web project for booking an ambulance for a patient according to their need (Basic, Advance, Air, Neonatal, Mortuary, etc). Administration can also add new ambulance through the administration portal. Doctor numbers, hospital numbers were also added so that people can take advice directly at their convenience. If a person confirms booking then an automatically generated message containing the address of a person is sent to the driver.
